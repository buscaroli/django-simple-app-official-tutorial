# Learning Django

Learning the Django framework following along the official [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial01/).

## Why

Django is taught as part of the futureproof curriculum and I need to learn the basics to be able to implement a simple app and to be able to understand others' code.
Django is the first monolith I have been exposed to (another interesting one to check out would be RubyOnRails).

## Tech

- Python
- Django
